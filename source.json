After I decided to persue coding more heavily, I tried to transition from wet-lab experiments to more computational methods. One of those tasks was to adapt a Computer Vision matlab script from detecting Active Transcription Sites (ATS) to distinguishing between two flavors of ATS, complete ATS and incomplete ATS. I was able to present preliminary findings at the national ASBMB conference (pictured above). The paper has just recently been sent for publication.",
